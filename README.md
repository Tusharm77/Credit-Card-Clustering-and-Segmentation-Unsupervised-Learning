# Credit-Card-Clustering-and-Segmentation-Unsupervised-Learning

Problem Statement : This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. 
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Approach:
a. Performed EDA and basic cleaning and pre-processing of the data
b. Built a K-means model for clustering the customers, evaluated model using silhouette coefficient and used elbow plot to determine optimal k value
c. Applied Principal component analysis to data to reduce dimensions and rebuilt k-means model to analyse whether better performace is achieved with reduced features
